RaffleGrabber
=============

Java program to automatically obtain and read citadel images (like [here](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScape:Clan_Chat/Citadel/Interfaces#Can_I_check_what_other_players_have_gathered.3F)).


About
=====
RaffleGrabber is a java program I have been working on for a short while to automatically take, crop and log raffle entries.

Its mostly self-explanatory, but feel free to ask me about it.

NOTE: I do not guarantee it running perfectly (in fact, tell me the bugs). I do not guarantee it working well/at all on non-windows OSs (it should, but I have no way to test this), and other such disclaimers.

Source available on GitHub: https://github.com/GazLloyd/RaffleGrabber
(source for v1.0.0 in subfolder)

If you want to see the logging messages, run this at the command line:

run cmd/terminal/whatever, navigate to Dropbox/Raffle entries, use command
	java -jar "Latest RaffleGrabber.jar"
Your command line window will now have log messages whenever something happens


Upcoming Features
=================
* Settings - expanded
* LogReader - can't understand the log? The built-in log reader will translate this into something more readable for you
* Ponies

Known Issues
============
None right now


lots of love,
Gaz
